These scripts are used for running rf_pipelines in order to inspect the RFI removal
in L1. They are written in the ch_frb_rfi format, meaning that you may have to study
[example2.py](../example2.py) in order to understand what they actually do.

Some minimal comments are provided in the beginning of each script. Please feel free to
add more if you discover a new feature in data or an idea on how to improve the RFI chain!
